# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
config_schema:
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs.
# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", get_cfg()->device.id);
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/sys_config.c or build/gen/sys_config.h file.
